1)Write a recursive function GCD to find the GCD of two numbers. Write a main program 
which reads 2 numbers and finds the GCD of the numbers using the specified function. 
Ex: GCD of 9,24 is 3

2)Write a recursive function FIB to generate nth Fibonacci term. Write a main function 
program to print first N Fibonacci terms using the function

3)Write a program to multiply two numbers using a recursive function
(Multipication using repeated addition)

4)Find the maximum number in the input integer array using pointers

5) Write a C program to swap two numbers using pointers (call by reference)
